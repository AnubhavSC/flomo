# flomo

`flomo` is a simple CLI for using the Flowtime Technique a.k.a. **Flowmodoro** Technique. It is a task execution helper, or in other words, productivity booster. `flomo` allows you to work on tasks in a flow state, track and manage your work/break time.

## Background

`flomo` is being built as a Hackathon project with @Jonak, Anubhav and Aqib Sir. We wanted to create a small scale project which was fun to make and possibly helped others as well. Moreover, we all are productivity fanatics.

## Flow and Flowtime Technique

[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) was known for his work on **Flow Theory**. He describes "flow" as[^1]:

> "A state of being in which people become so immersed in the joy of their work or activity 'that nothing else seems to matter.'"

And as developers/creators/romantics, we experience that state of "flow" often. This "flow" can **vary** at times, meaning that it can increase _or_ decrease.

This can easily be shown with a graph:

However, we can exploit that to our advantage and work efficiently, by finding the **right time** to take a break. And that right time is when the "flow" is depleting.
And this is called the Flowtime technique.

It works fairly simply:
**If you work for x amount of minutes, you should take a break for x/5 amount of minutes. And repeat.**

This calls for extensive amount of discipline. Which means that you must have at least some amount of natural focus. If not, I encourage you to check the Pomodoro Technique out.
